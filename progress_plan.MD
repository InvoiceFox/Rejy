DO:
- [x] add postfix evaluator for pipewords
- [x] add infix evaluator for opwords
- [x] add infix evaluator for opwords with more than 2 arguments
- [x] make further plans about modules, object system, write docs
- [x] add tag-word to parser
- [ ] add make-tag function with very simple or just no validation dialect
- [x] determine runtime representation of objects with tags (one for now)
- [ ] add tuple function 
- [ ] add object function
- [ ] add generic or multi function that creates user level generic method

THINK:
- [x] read and write about object system (protoypic but CLOS like)
- [ ] read more about modules / namespaces, try some options
- [ ] read more about scopes (bindology) do we need definitinal scoping, do we want, what would implementation be like, would in 
  slow down things or speed up?
- [ ] how are user function scoped, how is it implemented
