# Line noise

Let's say each of these languages removes one kind of line noise and introduces another.

### FORTH - Concatenative languages

PRO: these languages reject **variable names**. And many times variables are just noise that trashes the flow on logic.

CONS: the language introduces stack shuffling words, which is even bigger line noise.

PRO: to battle the line noise via shuffle words, some cool concepts were invented (look at factorcode.com)

CONS: but stack shuffling words are still there and noisy

### LISPS - homoiconic list based languages
