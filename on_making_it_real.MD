# On making it real :)

## If noone programs in your language, in a forest, did you even make a programming language?

Different weird and less weird programming languages are all around us. But except for the few language-nuts people, nobody really 
cares. Every language design idea has it's drawbacks and people have different tastes too. No language is good for everyone and
every problem, and on the other hand every language is more or less the same sh*t.

So usually, except for big platform plays (flash, javascript), big fashion/industry movements (java, ruby, javascript) most
people just use what most people around them use. It's a rational choice. Also, libraries, deployment and performace are the kings
and queens, and who has more of "them" than the encumbents?

So to think you will make a programming language soo cool (first problem) that everybody (second problem) will start using it 
(third problem) is just painfully naive. Counting on becoming fashionable (hit driven mechanics) is out of the question for
rational ones, and you don't want to optimise for it (because you will probably loose your core point - unless core point of 
your language is to be fashionable - which is fail on it's own).

## So what options does a small language-nut visionary have?

I believe you can only play the "platform game", but because you are micro-sized, your platforms can only be small niches. Because
I love making **tools** in general, my niches will be tools that not only have an api, but are directly programmable. I already
use the first version of my language Bagel as a import manipulation scripting language, for the B2B app I made. 

 * One such tool will be **rejywk** or **rjk**. I just wrote in the other document (6_...)
 * Next one will be markdown-like learning/notes tool (MVP made), that will also get programmable abilities
 * Third will maybe be tool to learn programming (MVP made), via Rejy
 * and so on ...
