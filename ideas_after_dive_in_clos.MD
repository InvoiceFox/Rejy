# Random ideas after diving in CLOS

## The "uber generic" function

I got to a collision in goals of generic functions and modules (namespaces / packages). To not invent the wheel (and probably doing
in in a dumb way) I went looking how CLOS/packages and Factor/vocabularies interact.

Unfortunately, so far I haven't gotten the answer. General instructions and documentation doesn't go that deep to describe this. 
Few people I asked also didn't quite answer me. Maybe they don't see the conflict there (maybe I don't understand enough to see
that there isn't) or didn't go as far/deep with generic funtions as I want to go.

**I will try to explain later where I see the oposite goals of typical namespaces/modules/packages and generic functions *as I see them*.**
