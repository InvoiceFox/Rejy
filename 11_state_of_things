## Go implementation

I am developing opwords in go version. Didn't have time for this past week, but want to push it in week ahead.

## Unmotivated Museum

I was remembering some awesome developers from the past. Like cube2 developer. He made language Lobster. While reading about it, 
it's sort of depressing. He is such an awesome developer, technically more advanced than me in any possible way. His language seems
much more advanced, faster, ant elegant ... and it made no impact. 

I rememebered some other great developers from the past ... the Pixel from Cave story. Kenta cho, ... I started looking into this
by finding extraordinaire people that made orca (midi programming env) and some other cool projects. I should make a webpage with
these exceptional individuals.

## Ryesh - rye shell

I saw and writing a basic shell (in go) is no big deal. Maybe we could write a Rejy / Rye shell that would give "power of rye" to
the command line. It would be like repl with default command execution and cd. 

Then I remembered my idea for online learning environment for kids. Where they would have @process @user @global (tuple space?) 
and @friend. This would make your shell device independant and also enable communication with friends. Like sending messages,
files, publishing to subscribers, subscribimg... etc. Besides you communicating via these scopes, you program could also do the 
same very simply. It would basically make service like twitter an OS level layer. Or extend your os, to twitter like 
communications.

## Ryk - rake for data

Has .ryk-init which can load functions, scripts, libs. Has functions to process JSON / XML streams also, turn text to JSON 
objects and reverse.
